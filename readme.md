### A Neovim setup

*Note.* To fix the 'kyazdani42/nvim-web-devicons' on mac os follow 
the instructions from: https://stackoverflow.com/q/72899162

*Note.* To support live grep and grep string with Telescope, install RipGrep: https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ripgrep 
*Note.* Install fd (find alternative) https://github.com/sharkdp/fd 
`:checkhealth telescope` to verify both RipGrep and fd are installed properly

TODO: add settings from ignore files for RipGrep and fd!
